# Market Sync 🛒
A Simple, Smart Shopping Assistant

Market Sync is a mobile app I built to solve a common problem: losing track of your budget while walking around a busy grocery store. It helps you plan what to buy, keeps you on budget while you shop, and shows you where your money went afterward.

🌟 What does it do? (The Product)
* **Smart Planning:** It remembers what you usually buy so you can build your list in seconds.
* **The "Trip Meter":** As you pick up items, a progress bar shows how much of your budget is left. No more surprises at the cash register!
* **Market Mode:** A special setting that hides the "Add" buttons while you are in the store so you don't accidentally click things while walking.

🏗️ How I Built It (The Process)
I used a "Design-First" approach to build this quickly:
1. **The Brain (Backend):** Used **Python and Flask** to handle the math and the database.
2. **The Memory (Storage):** Used **SQL** to save your history and **Browser Storage** to make sure the "Market Mode" doesn't turn off if you refresh the page.
3. **AI-Assisted Development:** I used AI as my "Junior Developer." I designed the system and the logic, and then used AI to help write the code faster. This allowed me to focus on the user experience rather than getting stuck on small coding details.

🛠️ Tech Used
* **Python/Flask** (The Engine)
* **SQL/SQLAlchemy** (The Database)
* **Bootstrap** (The Look)
* **JavaScript** (The "Sticky" Features)
